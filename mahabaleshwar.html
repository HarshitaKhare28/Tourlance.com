    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Legend says that a Yadava ruler from 13th century built a small temple and water tank at the source of the <img class="image1" src="image38.png">river Krishna. The area around Mahabaleshwar called the Vale of Jawali was ruled by the More (clan) who were vassals of the Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur. In 1656, the founder of Maratha empire, Chatrapati Shri Shivaji Maharaj on account of political circumstances, killed the then ruler of vale of Javali, Chandrarao More, and seized that area. Around that time Shivaji also built a hill fort near Mahabaleshwar called Pratapgad fort.<br><br>
    In 1819, after the demise of the Maratha empire, the British ceded the hills around Mahabaleshwar to the vassal state of Satara. Colonel Lodwick (Later General Sir Lodwick) after climbing the mountains near Mahabaleshwar, recommended the place as a sanatorium for the British forces to governor Sir John Malcolm of Bombay presidency. The Raja of Satara was granted other villages in exchange for the British getting Mahabaleshwar in 1828.In old records Mahabaleshwar was even called as Malcolm Peth after the governor. Mahabaleshwar started gaining prominence when British officials of Bombay presidency such as in 1828, and later Sir Mountstuart Elphinstone, Arthur Malet (for whom the seat at "Point Arthur" is named), Carnac, and many others became regular visitors. A lake called Venna lake was constructed in 1842 to collect water from perennial springs. The Venna river flows from this lake.Bartley Frere, the commissioner of Satara in 1850s built the road from Satara to Mahabaleshwar.
