        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Dal is a lake in Srinagar (Dal Lake is a misnomer as Dal in Kashmiri means lake), the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir. <br>
            The urban lake, is integral to tourism and recreation in Kashmir and is named the “Jewel in the crown of Kashmir” or “Srinagar’s Jewel”.<br>
            The lake is also an important source for commercial operations in fishing and water plant harvesting.</p><img id="image1" src="Frozen.jpeg">
        <p>The shore line of the lake, is about 15.5 kilometres (9.6 mi), is encompassed by a boulevard lined with Mughal era gardens, parks, houseboats and hotels.<br>
            Scenic views of the lake can be witnessed from the shore line Mughal gardens, such as Shalimar Bagh and Nishat Bagh built during the reign of Mughal Emperor Jahangir and from houseboats cruising along the lake in the colourful shikaras.<br>
            During the winter season, the temperature sometimes reaches −11 °C (12 °F), freezing the lake.</p>
        <p>The lake covers an area of 18 square kilometres (6.9 sq mi) and is part of a natural wetland which covers 21.1 square kilometres (8.1 sq mi), including its floating gardens.<br>
            The floating gardens, known as “Raad” in Kashmiri, blossom with lotus flowers during July and August.<br>
            The wetland is divided by causeways into four basins; Gagribal, Lokut Dal, Bod Dal and Nagin (although Nagin is also considered as an independent lake).<br>
            Lokut-dal and Bod-dal each have an island in the centre, known as Rup Lank (or Char Chinari) and Sona Lank respectively.<br>
            The houseboats are closely associated with Dal Lake which provide accommodation to tourists in Srinagar.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <img id="image1" src="Image2.jpg">
        <p>Dal is mentioned as Mahasarit (Sanskrit: महासरित्) in ancient Sanskrit texts. Ancient history records mention that a village named Isabar to the east of Dal was the residence of goddess Durga.
            This place was known as Sureshwari on the bank of the lake, which was sourced by a spring called the Satadhara.<br>
            During the Mughal period, the Mughal rulers of India designated Kashmir, Srinagar in particular, as their summer resort.<br> 
            They developed the precincts of the Dal in Srinagar with sprawling Mughal-type gardens and pavilions as pleasure resorts to enjoy the salubrious cool climate.</p>
        <p>During the Dogra Raj, the Dogra Maharaja of Kashmir restricted the building of houses in the valley, however, the British circumvented this rule by commissioning lavish houseboats to be built on the Dal.<br>
            The houseboats have been referred to as, "each one a little piece of England afloat on Dal."</p>
        <p>After the independence of India, the Kashmiri Hanji people have built, owned and maintained these houseboats, cultivating floating gardens and producing commodities for the market, making them the centre of their livelihoods.<br>
            The houseboats, closely associated with Dal also provide accommodation in Srinagar.<br>
            Following the Mughal, Afghan, Sikh and Dogra rule, the place has earned the epithet, "Jewel in the crown of Kashmir".</p>
