        <!-- About Section Start -->
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Raigad is a hill fort situated about 25 km from Mahad in the Raigad district and stands 2,851 feet above the sea level. <br>
            The British Gazette states the fort was known to early Europeans as the Gibraltar of the East.<br>
            Its decisive feature is a mile and a half flat top which has adequate room for buildings.
            In its prime, the fort had 300 stone houses and a garrison of 2,000 men.</p><img id="image1" src="Raighad_Fort1.jpg">
        <p>There are approximately 1,737 steps leading to the fort. <br>
            The Raigad Ropeway, an aerial tramway, reaches 400 meters in height and 750 meters in length, and allows visitors to reach the fort from the ground in only four minutes.<br>
            Many constructions and structures on Raigad were built by Chhatrapati Shivaji and the Chief Engineer was Hiroji Indulkar.<br> When Chhatrapati Shivaji made it his capital in 1674 upon being crowned the king of the Maratha kingdom,
            which later developed into the Maratha Empire</p>
        <p>Raigad is well surrounded by mountains and was considered secured.<br>
        The fort is surrounded on its north and east by Kaal River, and Gandhari River flows from its west side. 
        Fort Lingana is situated to the east side and Kokandiva to the north.<br> If the skies are clear, we can see Rajgad-Torna on the east and Pratapgad, Vasota and Makarandagad on the south.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <img id="image1" src="RFIMG1.JPG">
        <p>Raigad was known as the mountain of “Rairi” before it was captured by Shivaji Maharaj.
            Due to its impregnability,<br> Raigad was known as “Gibraltar of East”. In the 16th century, when this was not developed as a fort,<br> it was called by local people as “Rashivata” and “Tanas”.<br>
            Due to its shape of a tall oil lamp tower, it was also called as “Nandadeep”.</p>
        <p>The fort was initially used to keep prisoners during the Nizamshahi rule.<br>
            It was then ruled by the More clan of the Javli region. On 6th April 1656, Shivaji Maharaj besieged Rairi and captured it in May.<br>
            The then Subhedar of Kalyan was transporting the treasure of Adilshah to Bijapur, which was raided by Marathas and utilized to fortify Raigad.</p>
        <p>Raigad has been one of the most importance forts, and has been a witness of significant events – Shiv Raajabhishek (The Coronation ceremony of Shivaji Maharaj) was the most significant event in the history of India.<br>
            Shivaji Maharaj became the King of the newly formed Maratha kingdom after a struggle of more than 300 years.<br>
            Shivaji Maharaj took the blessings of Bhavani Mata of Pratapgad on 19th May 1674 and offered a golden umbrella (Chatra) to the goddess before the ceremony.<br>
            The ceremony took place on the auspicious day of 6th June 1674, which was a Saturday. </p>
